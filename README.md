# Enumerate

A webextensions add-on
([Firefox]()
or
[Chrome]())
to obtain search results directly from the URL bar

## Credits

- Inspired by the work of the Firefox add-on [CyberSearch](http://cybersear.ch/)

## Possible to-dos

1. Populate results based on Mediawiki API (where headers could advertise
    Mediawiki support?)
1. Make another extension based on this which uses `activeTab` permission and a
    different omnibox keyword to do a search of current site
